# springwebsocket




protocol which provides bi-directional communication channel b/w serve and client.

once the communication established b/w client and server,both can exchange info,
endlessly untill the connection is closed by any one of the parties.

main reason to choice websocket are over htpp ,where the client and ser v er need to exchange info at high frequency
and low latency

whent to use websocket:
    > websocket can make a web page be dynamic and intractive 
       for ex:news,mails need to update dynamically.
     
    >websocket client and serve can negotiate the use of the a 
    high level messaging protocol (for ex:  STOMP)
